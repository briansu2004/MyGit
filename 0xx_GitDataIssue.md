# Resolve the repo data issue

Scenario:

- Worked in a large team
- The repo has so many branches and transactions and has been using for many years

`git pull` got these messages

```text
Fatal: bad object refs/remotes/origin/Head
Error: fail to run repack
Already up-to-date
```

`git gc` also got the same messages

And found the file content is incorrect even it said `Already up-to-date`!

Because I could "verify" the correct code from the web UI - different with the local!!!

Tried to `git clone` again but this repo has too large history so it can't be downloaded with the VPN and firewall through the home Internet!

Tried `git branch -D` to delete the branch and checkout again but still got the same problem.

How to solve this problem?

**Solution**

The error "Fatal: bad object refs/remotes/origin/HEAD" indicates an issue with the reference to the remote repository's HEAD. This might be caused by a corrupted reference.

To address this issue, you can try the following steps:

1. **Check Remote Configuration:**

   Ensure your remote configuration is correct by running `git remote -v`. Verify that the URL is correct and that the remote HEAD reference exists.

2. **Fetch the Latest Changes:**

   Run `git fetch origin` to fetch the latest changes from the remote repository.

3. **Reset Remote HEAD:**

   If the issue persists, you can try resetting the remote HEAD manually:

```
git remote set-head origin -a
```

4. **Repack the Repository:**

   After addressing the HEAD issue, you can attempt to repack the repository:

```
git repack -a -d --depth=250 --window=250
```

5. **Run Git GC Again:**

   Finally, run `git gc` again and check for any error messages.
